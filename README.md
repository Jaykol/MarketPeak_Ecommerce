Project on usage of git and deployment of a website.
I created a git repository,
cloned the repository,
performed git add, git commit, git --config and git push to the repository.
created a git branch for development and performed a pull request and merge on the git repository.
I created an EC2 instance to deploy and host the website on AWS and also updated the website on AWS server.
